# gitlab-changelog-generator
Generates the changelog of a GitLab repository using its API

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before installing the generator, you need installed:
```
NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
```

### Installing
In the root directory, run:
```
npm install
```
NPM will download and locally install the required libraries.

### Running
To generate the changelog, run:
```
node create_changelog gitlab_url gitlab_project gitlab_private_token [--release_indicator ri]
```
- gitlab_url is the GitLab url of the repository
- gitlab_project is the name of the project
- gitlab_private token is the private token generated by GitLab. You can check here how to generate this token: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#creating-a-personal-access-token
- release_indicator is an optional argument that indicates whether the changelog will be created from the GitLab Tags or the GitLab Merge Requests. Possible values for release_indicator are _tags_ and _merge_requests_. Default is tags.

Example: 
```
node create_changelog http://example.gitlab.com myGitLabProject yAS8Kkmdcma2fjw09e --release_indicator tags
```

#### --release_indicator
- If the release indicator is _tags_, each GitLab tag will be considered a new release, and the commits inside this tag will be listed as features of this release.
- If the release indicator is _merge_requests_, each successful Merge Request (ie. with status _merged_) made to Master will be considered a new release.
